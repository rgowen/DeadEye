# DeadEye

DeadeEye is an Android application that connects to a Bluetooth barcode scanner for the purpose of scanning and retrieving information about books by their ISBNs.
Once activated, the Bluetooth connection runs as a service and items can be scanned whether or not the DeadEye activity is in focus or the screen is even on.
